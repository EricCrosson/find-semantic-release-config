**find-semantic-release-config** is a library to locate a project's semantic-release configuration.

The configuration rules, according to the [semantic-release readme]:

semantic-releaseâ€™s options, mode and plugins can be set via either:

- A `.releaserc` file, written in YAML or JSON, with optional extensions: `.yaml`/`.yml`/`.json`/`.js`/`.cjs`
- A `release.config.(js|cjs)` file that exports an object
- A `release` key in the project's package.json file
